# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This project is about visualizing the data of three datasets. These datasets include Iris, Abalone, and Seeds data, which are UCI data.
This project can be divided into several parts:
+ Data preprocessing, which in this project only requires data normalization.
+ Using PCA to select the best features for data visualization.
+ Visualizing the data.
+ Comparing the results of the three different datasets and examining each of the results.
